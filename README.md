predixi
=======

This is a project to predict Bixi numbers, using the historical data that Julia/Kamal/Fabrice have been scraping (Fabrice is not involved; he just has data)

The idea is to make a webapp where people can go and 

* Get projections of how many bikes there will be at a given station for the rest of the day
* Find out when they need to leave work to get a bike near them. 

Right now there is no code and we are working on

* an API for communicating between the predictions engine and the frontend
* a data store to for the training and the predictions engine to interact with
